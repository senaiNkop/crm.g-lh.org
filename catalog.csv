SECOND SERVICE,,1,,"The attitude in Gods presence; converting and being greedy for spiritual gift. A servant provides service to the one he serves in thoughts and in actions without escuses irrespective of time. THE LORD JESUS SAID YOU CAN NOT SERVE TWO MASTERS. The moment you love the Lord the more and better you serve those around you because it’s done unto the Lord. Mammon makes you serve the human master less because it’s of selfish interest. Your motive is a determinant of the success and failure of the task assigned. Never be the focus, the ideas you think are yours come from the Father. Don’t serve two master. Scripture tells you when the reward will be, it isn’t of this age. Your faithfulness is the ticket to reward. When you turn to the Lord veils are removed. You become what you look at, you will be opened to the traits of what you look at. Freedom from veils in mind and understanding comes from the Lord, you are being transformed in intensifying glory when you gaze intensely on the Lord. To participate in the reward you must be sanctified, set apart. The kingdom is given to the holy ones of God not to the justified ones of God. Don’t ever use the word personal next to a revelation because there is nothing under the sun. Be HUMBLE, maintain the heart of a student. The nature of sons of God is that they don’t die. Never say something to God and go lie down. Make a choice to believe. Sin disappears in your life when you love God because you are concerned of His emotions.

SATURDAY,22ND JANUARY 2022,1,ZION! LEAVE BABYLON PART 4,"Allowing people remove or spot the errors or faults in our lives (using the lice breakout analogy). Correcting people is hard (pastor’s story of how difficult it is). It is foolishness to quarrel with shepherds when you’re corrected. Speaking up when you see something wrong.

The one who hates correction is stupid. People who carry lies, expose them. The things that should bother you. Handing someone over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.

There is a way to behave in the church of the living God. You are not a christain because you hang around the church of God just as you cannot be a student just by attending classes.

It is a sin to hoard, hoarding is not saving. Everyone is permitted to save their extra for those in need. In your life the seed that comes in is the seed, if what you plant is bad it generates multiple bad seeds. When a tree is bad, kill that tree and plant a new tree. The word of the kingdom is the good seed. The word of the kingdom is the message that Jesus is coming to rule on the earth. God cannot use crooked means to achieve his purposes.",,,,
,2022,1,,"The word of God protects you then then the power(prayer} propels you.

The deeds you do in obedience to God is the warfare, you have enemies their job is to take you out and your job is take them out; one must take out the other. As you read the scriptures look for Christians and the devil; disobedience leads to bondage and obedience leads to victory. Idolatry is done by running after what others run after, it is covetousness and greed. Satan has a right to bite anyone who has no fence; satan rides on your fleshly nature.

FRIDAY,4TH MARCH 2022,1,,"Victory is assured if you are on the side of the Lord. If you are not on the Lord’s side anticipate failure. Calling on the name of the Lord is not just saying Jesus is Lord; you have to be under His authority. The concept of a Lord may do not understand this. Jesus came to fulfill the law; God does not break his own laws. Freewill is a measure of authority given, you give account for how you use your authority. There is a time for everything, it is wrong to start praying for your spouse from a young age rather pray to grow in the fruits of the spirit (Gal 5). A man’s life does not consists of the things he possesses. You collect things from the devil by getting it the wrong way. Christ must be taught (Heb 6:1-2). The connection between Christ and the fear of God (Isa 11 & 42:4), the teaching of the Lord teaches you to fear the Lord. How to identify true preachers. How to pray.

Not doing is a sin it is wickedness (the sheep and goat, Mat 25), doing requires practice till it becomes your default nature. What beauty for women means (1st Pet 3:3-4) if you are foll0owing people full of demons you are likely copying demonic activity. How to know you have demons? The process of the birthing of sin (James 1:12-16). There are two kinds of beauty; external and inner beauty; females be focused on inner beauty on acquiring a meek and quiet spirit. You have to die to vanity. Deliverance from demonic possession is for children of Israel. To be free you must the price and desire the freedom.",,,,
,,1,,Ammonites did not have the permission to afflict the children of Israel except they allowed them. The fear of the Lord drives away other fears. Males and females are part of the Sarah company which will bring forth the Isaac company. Satan wins battles by you giving him attention. God judges by what you do; sins of omission are as deadly as sin of commission. It is possible to live above sin. Those who insult Satan are usually bound by the enemy,,,,
SATURDAY,5TH MARCH 2020,1,,"There are different kinds of enemies; we must learn to recognize the enemies. The Midianites usually come when it come close to the time of harvest.

How Morning star ministries acquired a 500 hundred room hotel for a ridiculously low price in obedience to God; brief story on Rick Joyner’s life.",,,,
,,1,,"Pray for the convicting power of the Holy Spirit not power to impress. When the Lord of the harvest comes He looks for fruits; You don’t impress God with gifts. What the Warfare of Christianity is. The test for money is to see if you can be trusted with more money to do the will of God with. Ministry gifts, know it and serve with it. The difference between being trained through practicals and being commissioned. The war we face come from different enemies and we are to recognize the enemies. People are attacked for the harvest they are about to reap. People fall due to disobedience to little instructions. Be like a little child. The Duties of teachers and preachers in the body of Christ. Do not test the Lord your God. Do not spread rumours against a leader the devil uses this to accuse and attack you. (A root of bitterness). You are to be trained for every good work. 1 Cor 11; The Lord’s table. Live by the words of the Lord. Most of God’s great works are done without hype. Do not tempt the Lord your God. The number one way Satan kills Christians is through ignorance or sin. The major war is war against your soul. You do not give up sin gradually, you give it up at once. Listening to testimonies makes you see the goodness of God and helps you give up things easily.",,,,
,,1,,God answers prayers about things that matter. Jesus looks at the ones who are serving in righteousness and who delight in Him. Your works will be judged through fire. People will be paid back what they give up in the age to come. The version of Christianity that is boring is not the proper type.it is false doctrine to always be at the mountain top. Faith in God. The Ammonite spirit,,,,
SUNDAY,6TH MARCH 2022,1,,"The church is the pillar and ground of truth. The Remnant Company, Zion often speaks of those who remain after judgment has been executed. Judgment on Zion.

Meekness is having the power to put you on the right spot but refusing to do it.",,,,
(1S SERVICE),,1,,,,,,
SUNDAY ,,1,,"The trouble with Ukraine and Russia is how the 2nd World War started. Wise people take what God says and maximise their obedience on it. To follow God take what he says little by little and obey it. Brace yourself for the disasters coming on the earth (Jer 25:30). The will of the Lord is performed by the zeal of the Lord. Wise people are scared of the Lord. On judgment day you will be in front of God and you will be scared. Many since we commit is because of a lack of fear for God. Forgiveness is not equal to wiping away all consequences. The voice that condemns you is not the voice of the Lord. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. The absence of the fear of God makes you do evil. The fear of God is to be taught (ps 34). If you want to see miracles comply with the things God has told you to do. If you don’t want to fall, walk around with the consciousness that you can fall; overconfidence will kill you (The story of Peter). Consequences of sin. Be contented with being honoured once in a while. Live with a mentality seeks to help the poor. It is not wrong to have a place of honour. In a church meeting do not create discrimination (James 2).",,,,
(2nd Service),,1,,"Practice obedience. How to get rid of demons is by obeying. Satan can come through anybody including parents and siblings. Baptism of suffering. The qualification of being a disciple is putting God before your family (Lk 14:26). The kingdom of darkness knows if someone is a civilian or a soldier. Talk on persecution, if you cannot endure a little discomfort for Jesus when the anti-Christ comes you will follow him. Doubting clear things leads to confusion. Majority of prayers should be done privately. Preachers were called to preach truth, they may have different areas of emphasis. The bible does not refer to prosperity as money. Define words it helps with your understanding. Be concerned about your stance with God in the present. Talk on restitution. Many consequences of sins come later. God’s judgment usually come because the devil has filed a case against you successfully. There are different types of consequences, the older you are the worse a consequence is. Think of sin as seed. There are degrees of sin. (prov 6: 32-33). You cannot tell the Lord what to do (Isa 45:9-12).",,,,
,,1,,"Talk on commanding angels. You need the Lord to speak to you not just about spiritual things but about day to day decisions. Poverty keeps you focus.

See the story of Jonah, Saul of Tarsus. God leads people through the valley of the shadow of the death. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the one in which you have Koinonia with, it is both sweet and bitter. Everything will increase in the last day; the good and the bad. Anything that protects God’s people is equivalent to building a wall. When you are part of the people of the Lord you are part of the wall builders. A Tabernacle for the Lord is going to be put up in a day; for there to be building there must be peace, there is still fighting to be done. Fortification requires dedication and time, don’t joke with it. If you are amongst those who will build the walls you must sacrifice. Pray for what is on God’s heart. Comments on how we prayed for Benny Hinn and he announces in 24hrs of how he took the prosperity gospel too far. Comments on how we prayed for NAFDAC.

Warfare is real and practical, there are laws of warfare and not understanding them can be costly. The Kingdom of God, seeing the kingdom of God is different from entering it. You must be born of the word and the Spirit. Everything the devil gives, he gives at a price. The devil doesn’t give gifts.

SATURDAY,9TH APRIL,1,,"Exo 12, the Lord’s Passover has a protocol to meet the requirements of mercy. The Jews already had a form of calendar before the Passover; the Lord counts your life really from the time the blood of Jesus begins to speak for you. It is supposed to serve as a reminder of when you came to know the Lord. Without the fence of self-control knowledge will destroy you. There are levels of Self-control; you grow in self-control. You can know the Lord and be ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge (2 pet 1:5-8). Reasons why people are born again for a long time and are immature; worry, riches, pleasures of this life. The rich are poor in faith. You can be a rich person and have the practice of enquiring from God. Wisdom v Riches- the protection wisdom offers is in this age and in the age to come while riches provides protection only in this age. One of the ways you know God is sending you somewhere is that he provides the transport for it. Explanation of what poverty is; ways to be poor. The people who are not growing in faith, knowledge, self-control, brotherly kindness, love have forgotten that they have been cleansed from their past sin. When A Christian lacks self-control he has regressed to the point as though he is blind, you have lost the ability to be enlightened by Jesus. Jesus is the meat you are to eat, you eat the meat with bread. The yeasts of malice and wickedness. Who you have been listening to shows in what you say. Slander. Comments on the governors President Buhari appointed in the year 1988 (?) when he had total military power. Comments on Joe Biden’s gaffs.

Leaders of countries are attacked by ruling powers, the more influential you become the more the forces come. Life and death are the fruits of the tongue. You should try to buy the gift of God with money. (Acts 8:9-20, Num 22:7; 16) Diviners take fees for divination. Isaac did not die when he thought he was going to die, he lived for an extra 20 years.

How the army works- believer- discipleship (Soldiers in the Lord’s army). What you do and do not do is far more consequential than you can ever believe. The strategies for warfare includes putting on the whole armor of God, praying with all kinds of prayer. The strategy the enemy uses is keep them distracted.

The promise land is not in heaven. The First Resurrection. The people who partake in the General Resurrection the second death will have power over them; the second death is the lake of fire.

BE EXTRA CAREFUL IN NOT BREAKING THE LAW, do not break traffic laws, or throw things on the ground. Habitually do what is good. The easiest way to not be among the people renovating the earth is to be rich. “Life”- An expected kingdom on the earth. Comments on the Jesus Movement of food multiplying. God does not want you to have financial security. One of the clearest sign you out of God’s will in your business is that you will be burdened. There is a price for being wealthy it is that price that Jesus does not want you to be pay. The average wealthy person’s work does not end and he does not have time to do the will of God. The promise land is not heaven because there are still enemies. Making disciples. Jesus began the good work and wants to fulfill it with us. Comments on how the Ikot-Ekpene church started. In whatever you do, think is this teaching someone the word of God, prophesying or evangelizing. The word judge is rule (Rev 20:4), the book of Judges is about the rulers God gave Israel.

Comments on William Carry in India did ministry for 13years and had no convert till later. In the captivity of Babylonia people compromise everything. Don’t borrow money to give offering, the reward goes to the person who gave you. The gift of grace that was given can be lost, you made no use of it, trashed it and buried.  To rebuild you must ask the Lord to break your heart with what breaks his. God will often give you a revelation so that you can pray about it.",,,,

If the children of Israel had revered Moses they would have entered the promise land. There are levels of revelation and access. Skill in trickery. Make choices to willfully humble yourself. Moses body was dragged by Satan because likely it wasn’t in the promise land. Pride is called the sin of the Devil. Duties of an Overseer. The leaders in Government are civil leaders while the preachers are spiritual leaders. To have the real fire you must pay a price which is staying in the fire. It is against the will of God to be hungry even if you are in prison. The Spirit of excellence is an extra-ordinary spirit (Dan 5:12; 1:17-20). Marriage; those who marry will face many troubles. God talking to Moses face to face explained. If you want to be proud you will get many opportunities to be proud.

THURSDAY ,14TH APRIL  2022,1,JERUSALEM ,"Ezek 22:30, it talks about building the wall and not just praying. Building a wall is different from praying it requires work. It is restoration. Rebuilding the wall is what shows mercy to a land and not prayer. A day of indignation is the day of wrath. The wickedness people resort to, to further their aim causes great offence to the Lord. Blood speaks over blood, the blood of Jesus can speak over murder. The power of sin; stones, blood can cry out for vengeance. Blood guiltiness. There are things you must do for the rain to come; you need the rain in the day of indignation. You cannot hold unto your wicked ways while seeking the Lord’s face. Pride. Repentance is always actions. There was never any prayer and fasting without turning from our evil ways. (Jonah 3:8). The job of the Priest is to distinguish the common and holy. There must be Sabbaths, this is when you distinguish between the holy and the profane. A prophet turns the people from their sin. It is possible to see deep clear visions that are lying visions activated by lying spirits. You must not have idols in your heart. Comments on the evils happening in the church.

The church is Jerusalem and when she commits idolatry it is spiritual adultery. (Num 5:12-23). To know the procedure you must look into the law of God and then apply it.
